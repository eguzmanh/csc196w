        <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
        I am currently a Senior at Sacramento State University. 
        I will be graduating with a B.S. in Computer Science and I plan to pursue
        music production on the physical aspect and synchronozing that with embedded systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love to play guitar on my free time and I also now engage in a lot of cross-fit acitvities.
      I'm not sure what else to put in this about me, but I have experience with web development 
      and it is awesome to be able to practice these fundamental concepts once more.
